# Japanese Character Practice Tool

In an effort to get better at Japanese, I have created this tool to help me practice characters and the specific sounds that they make.

To try this practice tool, install the packages with `npm install` or `yarn install` depending on your preference. 

Then run `npm start` to start your practice session.

Choose from one of the 3 main character sets used in written Japanese to get 10 random characters. Choosing Hiragana or Katakana will give you exercises that ask you to provide the correct sound for character, whereas Kanji will give you the Kanji and Hiragana and ask you to translate the character to English
